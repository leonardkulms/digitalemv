# README

This is a Ruby On Rails Project I built to partly digitize the _mitgliederversammlungen_ (like general meetings for decicion making in a non-profit).
I felt the itch that we needed this because it always felt so boring and repetitive to count the votes by hand. We still met to talk decisions through but at the moment of voting we just used the app. 
We successfully hosted multiple _mitgliederversammlungen_ in this manner at the Venture Club MÃ¼nster. 

A live version can be found on https://digitalemv.herokuapp.com/. For a live demo you can text me on linkedin.

I do not maintain this project at the moment, you are welcome to use the code to host your _mitgliederversammlungen_ at your own risk, though.
